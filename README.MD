# Basic Python
---

This is a basic template repository for python development. It does the following:
- Automates testing and linting using nox
- Uses dagger to unify testing and linting on the development machine and in CI.
- Manages packages using a combination of Anaconda and Poetry.

To run locally you will need to install `conda-lock` and `conda`.
